# Hi there, I'm Abhishek Kanaujia! üëã

I am a graduate of Computer Science with a B.E. Degree. I bring over four years of experience in Unity Engine. I use native tools with external frameworks for multiplayer, XR (including MR, AR, and VR), serial data communication, web requests, and more. I enjoy prototyping, creating POCs, and thriving on the challenges, and have a strong desire to transition into a core game development role.
